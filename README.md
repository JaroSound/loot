Ver 2.1

Thanks to Cryptos' loot for the base of this
and A HUGE thanks to Poke for helping me out!
the skinning is baised on Juan_Hunting cfg layout since a lot of the work has already been done.
!!!! WARNNING !!!!! 
This will not work with Juan_Hunting by default

Not all Ped Models have been added to the loot.
	



Changes

	Fixed typo in addXP, now gives XP per loot
	started support for skinning animals
	started support for picking up small "Critter" like carcuss
	started support for Plucking (SKINNING) birds.
	Item Loot table so you can loot random things from the npc's -- just add the items in the nil place
	RDO style looting prompts
	Updated config to remove nil errors
	Fixed skinable = false (overkilled them while trying to keep cheatting down)
